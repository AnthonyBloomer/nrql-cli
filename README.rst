About
-----

The New Relic Insights query API is a REST API for querying Insights
event data. After you supply a standard NRQL query via HTTPS request,
the query API returns a JSON response for parsing.

To use the API, you need a query key. You can have multiple query keys,
and any query key can be used to initiate any Insights API query. If you
have multiple systems querying Insights or different data destinations,
New Relic recommends you use multiple query keys to enhance data
security.

To create a new query key:

1. Go to `insights.newrelic.com <https://insights.newrelic.com>`__ >
   Manage data > API keys.
2. Select the plus icon next to the Query keys heading.
3. Enter a short description of the key.
4. Select Save your notes.

You will also need make note of your New Relic Account ID. To find the
account ID for your New Relic account:

1. Sign in to `rpm.newrelic.com <https://rpm.newrelic.com>`__.
2. In the URL bar, copy the number after the /accounts/ portion of the
   URL: ``https://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/ACCOUNT_ID/``

Installation
------------

nrql-cli is available on the Python Package Index (PyPI) at
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nrql-cli

You can install nrql-cli using pip.

::

   pip install nrql-cli

Export your `Query API
key <https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/get-started/intro-apis/understand-new-relic-api-keys>`__
and `Account
ID <https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/account-id>`__
as environment variables:

.. code:: shell

   export NR_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY'
   export NR_ACCOUNT_ID='YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID'

Then, run:

::

   nrql

This command will start the program and you can start querying your
data!

Alternatively, you can run in Docker. You will need to update the
`Dockerfile <https://github.com/AnthonyBloomer/nrql-cli/blob/master/Dockerfile>`__
with your API key and account id and then run:

.. code:: shell

   docker build -f Dockerfile -t nrql-cli .
   docker run --rm -it nrql-cli

Usage
-----

::

   usage: nrql [-h] [--region {EU,US}] [--env ENV] [--verbose]

   optional arguments:
     -h, --help            show this help message and exit
     --region {EU,US}, --r {EU,US}
                           Pass this flag to set your region (EU or US) By
                           default the region is set to US.
     --env ENV, --e ENV    Environment handler.
     --verbose, --v        Pass this flag if you want the whole response.

Managing multiple accounts
--------------------------

If you wish to easily switch between your New Relic accounts, you can
use the ``--env`` switch:

.. code:: bash

   nrql --env PROD

By default, the program looks for the environment variables
``NR_API_KEY`` and ``NR_ACCOUNT_KEY``.

If the ``env`` argument is not none, then the program appends the
environment string to ``NR_API_KEY``. For example:

::

   NR_API_KEY_PROD

When naming your environment variables, ensure to follow this naming
convention.
